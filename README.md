*Here are some of the projects I've worked on. Each project includes a detailed breakdown of the process, from data sourcing to final insights.*

   ## Project 1: Student Information System ‚Äì University Database
        This project is a complete relational database for a university's Student Information System (SIS), 
        built from the ground up using MySQL. The objective was to design a normalized and efficient database schema,
        implement it using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL), populate it with realistic sample data, 
        and demonstrate my data retrieval skills by writing a series of analytical queries.
